            <p><b class="montserrat">MENCH</b> is an interactive microblogging platform on blockchain. Microblogs are different than traditional blogs as they focus on a single idea, can link to each other collaboratively and be up-voted by citing references such as books or articles. Bloggers use a simple web app to store, organize and publish ideas that matter. Readers enjoy an interactive and personalized reading experience over the web or Messenger. Our mission is to build an open idea index that makes relevant information more accessible.</p>
